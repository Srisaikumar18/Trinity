        Into the Enchanted Forest:<br>
As dawn breaks, Alex gathers supplies and steps into the dense greenery of the Enchanted Forest. The air is filled with the sounds of chirping birds and rustling leaves. The map indicates two possible paths: one leading deeper into the dark and mysterious part of the forest, and the other towards a glimmering stream that promises to be serene but possibly unhelpful in the treasure hunt.
